Little Florijan is trying to remember a number (very important one, number of roses for Paula), but he just thinks of her and seems too distracted.

Fortunately, you can help him. Once he calculates the right number of roses he has to give to Paula, he will give it to you. You have to remember that number and give him when he asks for.

Remember, Paula is very peevish. If Florijan gets the wrong number from you, he will be refused!

### Input
> Number **R** that Florijan calculated; (1 <= **R** <= 100)

### Output
> Number **R** that you're keeping for Florijan.
